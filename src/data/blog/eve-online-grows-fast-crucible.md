I’ve been playing EVE Online since the summer of 2008, and have kept aclose eye on the state of things from time to time. CCP releases a free
“expansion” every six months with lots of goodies in them. The latest,
[Crucible](http://www.eveonline.com/en/crucible/features/), is the first that I can remember to be a pure
refinement-of-existing-concepts release.

There’s a great short list of the major points on the [Crucible features
page](http://www.eveonline.com/en/crucible/features/), and a much longer, blow-by-blow [changelog](http://www.eveonline.com/updates/patchnotes.asp?newpatchlogID=3219) that drills down
into individual changes.

What makes Crucible so tasty?
-----------------------------

CCP took a step back, listened to player feedback, and delivered…
bigtime. This release was almost entirely devoted to addressing design
warps, imbalances, and player-requested things. A few of my favorite hilights:

* Tier 3 Battlecruisers. These things are very cool. Battleship weapons
  on a Battlecruiser.
* Extensive UI tweaks, and a new font that makes some characters more
  distinguishable. Too many tweaks here to even get into. “Rubber band
  selection” is one of my favorite changes, though.
* Hybrid Weapons Re-balanced to be a lot more useful.
* Destroyers were buffed.
* Supercaps were hugely nerfed. Hooray, we’ll see diversity in cap
  battles again (hopefully).
* Titans were pretty majorly nerfed as well. No more drones, or
  shooting sub-caps. HP reduction, too.
* Reduction of session timer. This was a huge pet peeve for me at the
  previous 30 seconds. It’s now 10, and I think you can almost
  instantly change ships in hangars now.
* Corporation bookmarks. Yay!
* Lots and lots of graphics tweaks and re-touches. There were too many
  to list on my little blog, but the game is looking better than ever.

Let’s hope this trend continues
-------------------------------

The last handful of expansions were feature-heavy, and weren’t
necessarily aiming at things that the players were requesting. Captain’s
Quarters were notoriously half-baked and badly received. They’re a
glorified tech demo. New nullsec sovereignty mechanics were just as bad
as the old ones, arguably worse. Wormholes were dropped in and mostly
not iterated on at all.

With this expansion, rather than add more half-baked garbage, CCP did
the best thing and went back to iterate on things that needed some polish.

Lessons to apply to software development
----------------------------------------

The major points to keep in mind for your own software development,
after watching CCP really stumble through the last few years:

1. Listen to your customers! EVE saw some pretty severe reductions in
   subscriber base as it kept pushing to expand the feature list.
2. Don’t keep pushing to expand your feature list without re-visiting
   existing things that need further iteration.
3. Most importantly, don’t leave a trail of badly designed, or
   half-broken systems behind you as you march towards more features.

Let’s hope that future expansions strike a good balance between
iterating existing things and adding the new. This expansion certainly
fits the bill.
