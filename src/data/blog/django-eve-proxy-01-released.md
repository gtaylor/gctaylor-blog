I am pleased to announce the release of [django-eve-proxy](http://code.google.com/p/django-eve-proxy/) 0.1. This isa simple proxy/cache app for Django that you may drop in to assist in
accessing the API through your Python modules, or with a urls.py entry,
via HTTP.

Although young, django-eve-proxy should be fully functional and ready to
go. All comments, feedback, and suggestions are appreciated.
