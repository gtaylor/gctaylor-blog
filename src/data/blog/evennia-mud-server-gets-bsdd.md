As of a few days ago, the [Evennia MUD server](http://evennia.com/) has been re-licensedunder the BSD License. We feel like this will knock down another barrier
for those considering running a game with Evennia. I can’t recommend
this codebase enough for anyone who may have caught the MUD development
itch (hey, they still exist!). Griatch has been doing an awesome job
making improvements and building a community.

Evennia is an advanced Python+Django MUD server, with all sorts of
goodies (like a web-based client). While the project has been going on
for a number of years, the community has been growing a bit faster over
the last year or two. We hope this will help continue that trend.

Feel free to stop by #evennia on FreeNode IRC to lurk, hang out, or ask questions.
