For anyone who plays EVE Online, I have a proposition for you. Myselfand a few nerdy corpmates have been working on the [django-eve](http://code.google.com/p/django-eve/)
projects, which are a collection of Django apps for EVE Online. We’re
looking at trying to get more people involved with the project, whether
it be providing feedback, patches, or joining up with us longer term.

Our eventual goal as a corporation would be to use these various
open-source components to assemble some public-facing, paid (in in-game
currency) services that would fund our addictions. If you are interested
in joining a/the Django EVE developers corp, send me a buzz and take a
look at our [corporate website](http://blackmanindustries.com) (not a whole lot to see).

If you’d like to talk in-game, buzz me as **Ilyk Halibut** or **Grant
Blackman**.
