[paypal-python](https://github.com/gtaylor/paypal-python) 1.2.4 is a minor bugfix release with one adjustment to imports for Python 3 compatibility. [Get it](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paypal/) while it's hot!

Also, as mentioned in a [previous](http://gc-taylor.com/blog/2015/11/11/paypal-python-123-released-maintainer-needed) blog post, I'm looking for a new maintainer for paypal-python. I'm no longer interested in actively maintaining it, but there is a good sized userbase out there.
