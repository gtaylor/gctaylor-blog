Just looking through [DjangoSites.org](http://djangosites.org) and Googling around, I’mabsolutely puzzled by the lack of Django-based browser games. It is such
an idea platform for developing these, yet there are only a few that are
actually open to the public (some of which aren’t in English, and are
thus inaccessible to me). There seem to be a few games out there in
French, Chinese, and some other things I don’t really recognize, though.

Here are a few games in English I’ve been able to round up:

* [My Dark Secret](http://www.mydarksecret.com/) - A murder mystery game of some sorts.
* [You Are Hunted](http://tibia.webdoisonline.com/yah/) - I’m not really sure :)

I’m particularly interested in anything open-source, as I’d love to
contribute from time to time, but I’d love to hear of any playable games
that I have missed, or any open-source games in development. As far as
close-sourced games in development, they’re not of much interest to me
if they’re at least not open for testing. Without access to the source
or a reachable site, it’s as good as vaporware (and many of them never
see completion).

So speak up, let me know if there’s something that I’ve completely missed!
