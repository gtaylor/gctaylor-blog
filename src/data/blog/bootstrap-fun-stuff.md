I recently re-vamped my site to use Twitter’s Bootstrap CSS. This endedup being pretty easy to switch to, and I had to tweak the styles very
little. My designer sensibilities are pretty terrible, so stuff like
this is a real treat. If you haven’t already, consider checking
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) out.
