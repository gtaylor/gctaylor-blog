Postgres 9 has been out for a while, tempting me with some what appearto be great improvements. I’ve been considering using it for a Django
project, but wasn’t sure if there’d be much improvement from the 8.4
currently packaged with the Ubuntu Server 10.10 we deploy on.

For those who have already used Django + Postgres 9: What do you think
so far? Any measurable gains in performance? Anyone played with the new
replication stuff yet?

I’ll leave this pretty open-ended, comment away.
