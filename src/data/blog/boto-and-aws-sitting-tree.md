On a [post](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/01/big-news-regarding-python-boto-and-aws.html) in the [Amazon Web Services blog](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/01/big-news-regarding-python-boto-and-aws.html) yesterday, AWS hasannounced that it has brought Mitch Garnaat (maintainer of the excellent
[Boto](https://github.com/boto)) on board:

> […] Building on this model, Mitch Garnaat has also joined the
> team. Mitch has been a member of the AWS community for over 6 years
> and has made over 2,000 posts to the AWS Developer Forums. He is
> also the author of boto, the most popular third-party library for
> accessing AWS, and of the Python and AWS Cookbook.

Great news, but what are they going to do with Mitch, and what will his
involvement with Boto be?

> Boto will continue to exist as an open source project and we will be
> making official contributions to it.

They go on to list a few related job openings, one of which is a [Python
engineer (AWS Developer Resources)](https://us-amazon.icims.com/jobs/162452/job?in_iframe=1). This looks, to me, like a great
“official” endorsement of [Boto](https://github.com/boto) **and** Python. As someone who uses
Boto (and Python) extensively for work and play, this looks exciting.

A big congratulations goes out to Mitch, for nabbing a great job, and
for being able to work on Boto within Amazon directly.
