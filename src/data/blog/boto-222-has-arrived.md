[boto 2.2.2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto) was released this morning, comprised mostly of bug fixes.Of particular interest is the DynamoDB stabilization that has happened
over the last few weeks, although a number of other minor bugs were
fixed with the other services. For anyone currently running on older
versions, we highly recommend upgrading to [boto 2.2.2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto).
