One of the worse parts about writing a codebase from scratch for aspecific game is the staggering amount of foundation work that has to
happen before you can really start making visible progress. Database
layers, object representation and manipulation, account management,
exits, and a basic set of global commands are all necessary before much
of anything ‘visible’ can happen. Plus, these are only just going to get
you started in breaking ground on your world.

I know right now that my project ([Dawn of the Titans](https://github.com/gtaylor/dott)) lacks such
basics as a communication system, a full set of builder commands, the
ability to IP ban and flood control, and a sane way to handle color.
Furthermore, I have yet to dig room 1 of my world, or start writing the
fun stuff like combat and space flight systems.

It’s easy to look at my mile-long to-do list and get intimidated/psyched
out, and at times, I have. In particular, the tasks that are either
extremely uninteresting, tedious, or require a lot of re-arranging tend
to really make me cringe. I end up putting these off, and further
progress slows or comes to a halt.

Speed Bumps
-----------

There are probably much better terms for this, but I call issues on a
to-do list that I dread the most “Speed Bumps”. Sometimes this is due to
complexity, other times due to being very uninteresting or tedious. More
often than not, these items are required for progress to continue.
Unfortunately, these are also the most likely to go neglected.

By putting off these “Speed Bumps”, our progress is slowed, morale may
drop, and motivation might go with it. Development momentum slows, and
we may even come to a complete stop for periods. This is not good, given
that you probably have at least a year’s worth of work to get a 100%
custom MUD in playable shape.

Flying through the Speed Bumps
------------------------------

I have found that the best way to get past my cringeworthy tasks is to
try to find something really simple and quick that I can do to at the
start of a development session. It could be fixing a spelling error or
writing a paragraph or two of documentation. It lets me get a commit
under my belt, and I feel rewarded for making progress.

From there, the most “dreaded” of my tasks is where I start. After
thinking, doodling, and writing a line or two of code, I lose the
concrete shoes and I’m off to the races. **The hardest part of getting
past speed bumps is getting motivated enough to start working**.

Attack the things you’re dreading; try to find some way to get excited
about them. If it’s a particularly boring task, try to make it
interesting by thinking of what you’ll be able to do down the road with
what you’re working on.

For those masochistic enough to write an entire codebase for their
particular game in mind, keep one very important thing in mind: You knew
going into this that it was going to be a very long road. Don’t be
discouraged by this, and instead be happy that you’ve got a great
project to poke at when you feel like it over a year or two, or five. If
it makes it out the door to live players, wonderful. If it doesn’t,
hopefully you at least enjoyed working on it.
