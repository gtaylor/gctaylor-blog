Thanks to liushie, a math domain error was caught in the CIE1994 and CMCcolor difference methods. This only manifested itself for certain CIELab
values, and went unnoticed as a result of this. The problems have been
corrected and released as 1.0.6.

Please see the [project page](http://code.google.com/p/python-colormath/) for more details on what
python-colormath, how to install it, and how to use it. This is unlikely
to interest you if you are not looking to do some kind of color math.
