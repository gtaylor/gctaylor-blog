Version 0.3.0 of [wxJSON](http://lnx.mauriziovettorato.it/public/json/home.html) has been released. The important feature thisbrings about is Unicode support (for those who have been waiting for
it). From what I can tell, the release doesn’t add or improve anything else.

[wxJSON](http://lnx.mauriziovettorato.it/public/json/home.html) is a [JSON](http://json.org/) writer/reader for [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org), a great C++ GUI
library. Head over to the [wxJSON](http://lnx.mauriziovettorato.it/public/json/home.html) site for more details.
