For those reading along elsewhere, I apologize for the incorrect domainon the feed up until now. I forgot to set my Site’s domain within the
admin interface, meaning everything syndicated pointed to example.com.
This has been fixed and won’t be an issue in the future. Sorry for the
additional spam.

To see the affected article (really, this time), [Django and wxWidgets:
A match made in heaven](http://gc-taylor.com/blog/post/6/).
