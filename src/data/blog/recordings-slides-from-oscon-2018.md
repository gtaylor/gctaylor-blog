I had the opportunity to present at OSCON 2018 this year. My session was [Herding cat pictures: How to develop, deploy, and operate services at Reddit scale](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or-2018/public/schedule/detail/67193). I talked through our rapid growth as an engineering org, some of the growing pains that resulted, and how we shifted our Infrastructure team from operations to enablement.

* I've also posted the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/GregoryTaylor11/develop-deploy-and-operate-services-at-reddit-scale-oscon-2018).
