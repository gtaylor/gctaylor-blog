I have made the source for the CMS/Blog that powers this site availableon Google Code in the hopes that someone out there will find it useful.
It’s not very well commented at this time, but it’s fundamentally sound
code and serves as a decent example of things. This is mostly to help
make it easier for me to track revisions, but there’s no harm in GPL’ing it.

The source is located on the [greg-cms](http://code.google.com/p/greg-cms/) Google Code project (creative
name, yes?).
