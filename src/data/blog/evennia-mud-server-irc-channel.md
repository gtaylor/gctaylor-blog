To improve collaboration, the Evennia MUD Server project now has an IRCchannel on Freenode, #evennia. We have taken it a step further and
linked this up with our test game, so those messing around in-game can
still talk/listen on the IMCEvennia channel (which is also replicated to
the MudBytes Inter-MUD network).

Evennia is a Python+Twisted+Django-based MUD server. For those that who
have no idea what this is, it’s a base for a persistent, text-based MMO.
As far as I know, Evennia is the first MUD built on top of Django, and
we’d love to see more community members stop by to help. Feel free to
pop in IRC, join the IMCEvennia channel if you’re on the MudBytes IMC2
network, or join the Google Group at <http://evennia.com>.
