I just thought I’d provide a friendly heads up to the Django and Pythoncommunities that the Python 2.6 distributed with MacPorts does not
compile on Snow Leopard as of now. This issue is outlined on [MacPorts
ticket #20284](http://trac.macports.org/ticket/20284).

There are some really hacky work-arounds, but they are not for the feint
of heart. This is reportedly an upstream Python problem, and has been
reported as such by the MacPorts community. While Python 2.6 is included
with Snow Leopard, MacPython requires its own Python26 package for many
other things.

Other than that, Snow Leopard has been great. This is not a complete
show-stopper since you can just manually install stuff, but it is
somewhat annoying.
