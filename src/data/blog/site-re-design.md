Under harassment from friends and a professor or two, I finallyre-designed my page. You will notice a new look, and some extra
functionality floating around. The back-end is now [Django](http://djangoproject.com) instead of
static HTML. This will allow me to make some of my tinkerings available
for view on here.

Things will be in a state of flux for a while as I get the kinks worked
out. If you notice any oddities, feel free to [email me](mailto:gtaylor@clemson.edu).
