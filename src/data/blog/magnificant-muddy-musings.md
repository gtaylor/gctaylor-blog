The [Evennia MUD Server](http://evennia.com/) has been progressing through beta at a goodclip, with much effort spent on fine-tuning existing features, and
expanding on the already excellent pile of [documentation](http://code.google.com/p/evennia/wiki/Index?tm=6). Much to my
delight, the current maintainer, Griatch, has started to [blog](http://evennia.blogspot.com/) about
Evennia development. If you are at least somewhat interested in keeping
an eye on a Python+Twisted+Django MUD server, consider taking a peek at
[Griatch’s Evennia Musings](http://evennia.blogspot.com/).

While the blog details Evennia development, there is a lot of valuable
general-purpose stuff as well. Especially for those writing, or
considering writing, a MUD server using some or all of the same building blocks.

For those who would like to harass the man (or the other
users/developers) in person, stop by #evennia on FreeNode.
