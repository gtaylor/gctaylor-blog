I am happy to announce that [python-fedex](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fedex/) and [python-colormath](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colormath/) havebeen re-licensed under the BSD License. At the time these two packages
were created, there were reasons for GPL’ing these. However, said
reasons have long since been removed, so it’s BSD time!

My involvement with both of these projects has been minimal since I
joined DUO Interactive, since we don’t have a use for either. However,
my hope is that a more permissive license will encourage contributions.
I still review pull requests for both of these when they appear, and
would be very much open to capable individuals taking over
maintainership of either.
