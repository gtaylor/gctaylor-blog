To help silence some over-aggressive logging within what is an otherwise handled exception, I have cut [paypal-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paypal/) 1.2.3 and released to PyPi.

paypal-python is for use with the oldschool [NVP API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/endpoints/).

Maintainer(s) needed!
---------------------

I have zero interest in maintaining this package anymore. If anyone who uses paypal-python is interested in stepping up and taking the lead, please get in touch via the issue tracker or the [Contact me](http://gc-taylor.com/contact/) page on my site.

Otherwise, this may be the end of the road for future releases! 1.2.3 is such a nice version number to end it on.
