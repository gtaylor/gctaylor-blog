While by no means at all ready to be deemed “mature”, [django-eve-db](http://code.google.com/p/django-eve-db/)is now at a state that I feel fine about announcing its presence to the
wider Python/Django community.

[django-eve-db](http://code.google.com/p/django-eve-db/) is a set of Django models that wrap CCP’s EVE Online
data dump. This makes it extremely easy to query the dump and rapidly
develop software around it. Little to no SQL is required for many usage cases.

I could really use some help testing the models, importers, and admin
classes. If you are a current or potential EVE Online developer, I
encourage you to take a peek. If you’d like to hear discussions and
announcements about the project, see our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/django-eve).
