description: Recordings from my presentation at KubeCon 2019, covering Reddit's trials and tribulations with Kubernetes in production.

Following up on last year’s [Kubernetes at Reddit: An Origin Story](https://gc-taylor.com/blog/2018/12/26/recordings-slides-from-kubernetes-at-reddit-an-origin-story-at-kubecon-na-2018), I have presented the *eagerly* anticipated sequel at KubeCon NA 2019: Kubernetes at Reddit: Tales from Production. The 2018 talk covered the early results of Reddit’s Kubernetes migrations, plus some of our future aspirations. This year’s edition revisits the last year of our adoption story, what worked, what did not, as well as details on what is next.

If you’d like to see the talk, see the [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbIBqNcjoQ) and/or the [slides](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccncna19/cb/Kubernetes%20at%20Reddit_%20Tales%20from%20Production.pdf).

Many thanks to all who attended the session!
