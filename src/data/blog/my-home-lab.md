![ Magnificent cable management and all ](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/561aafd6e4b02c7f0270ba4f/c7f34ef2-30cf-4013-a20c-151f40fcba4f/PXL_20220126_071219056.jpg?format=original) Magnificent cable management and all 

Hideous…ly effective.

The rundown:

* 1x Unifi Dream Machine
* 2x Unifi US-8-60W switches
* 3x Intel NUC NUC10i3FNK - Kubernetes control nodes + some workload
* 1x Synology DSM220+ NAS - NFS for PV, Docker registry, Vault
* 1x custom beefy desktop (left), only runs if/when I need extra compute.
* 1x 2011 Macbook pro - GitHub Actions self-hosted runner

I mostly use this setup for experimenting with Kubernetes and PaaS-related things on top of it.
