We were fortunate enough to be able to [present](https://kccna18.sched.com/event/GrRp/kubernetes-at-reddit-an-origin-story-greg-taylor-reddit-inc) some of what’s going on with Reddit’s Kubernetes adoption at KubeCon NA this year. Subject matter covered includes:

* The motivations behind adopting Kubernetes.
* The vision behind the things we are building on top of Kubernetes.
* Some of the challenges we’ve faced in our journey.
* How we’re using what we’ve built (and are building) to change how we develop, deploy, and operate software at Reddit.

If you are curious, see the [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7TIzCAEo0M) and/or the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/GregoryTaylor11/kubernetes-at-reddit-an-origin-story-kubecon-na-2018).
