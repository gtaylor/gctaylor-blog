After a lengthy delay, [python-colormath](http://python-colormath.readthedocs.io) 3.0.0 has been released. The big changes are requiring networkx>=2.0 and shifting our Python 3 support from 3.3/3.4 to 3.5/3.6. See the [release notes](http://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release_notes.html) for the full details.

Impending Archival
------------------

I'll probably give this release a while to simmer in the wild to make sure I didn't break anything. At some arbitrary point in the next few months, I intend to archive python-colormath in Github so users understand that it will no longer be maintained. This codebase is now ten years old, needs more love than I can afford to give it, and I'm very far from this subject matter these days.

If you are interested in taking the reigns, please get in touch with me and we can talk potential fit!

Update: Jan 2018
----------------

We have some preliminary interest, so the project remains un-archived. We're working through a few updates and will see if activity remains steady enough to transfer the project over!
