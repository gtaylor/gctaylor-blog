The author of the [EVE Marketeer Uploader](https://bitbucket.org/aeolun/eve-marketeer-uploader) has decided to open sourcethe project, which is great news for the EVE community. It appears to
have a large amount of traction, this move will guarantee its survival
into the future, and allow other people to contribute to the project.

The first few things I can think of tackling are:

* Packging this up for Mac OS. They’ve got a py2exe’d Windows distro,
  should be easy to do the same for Mac.
* Provide clear instructions for running under Linux. This is probably
  more of a pointing our requirements, rather than packaging.

Kudos to Bart Riepe for opening this up!
