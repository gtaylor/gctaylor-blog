seacucumber 1.5 was released, and is a pretty important (albeit minor)update to correct our unicode handling. The minimum boto version was
raised to 2.3, so we can make use of the more specific SES exceptions
seen in later releases.

[Grab it from PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/seacucumber/) or pip/easy\_install away.
