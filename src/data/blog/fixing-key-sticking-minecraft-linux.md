I finally got fed up enough with my directional keys sticking onMinecraft (Linux version) to dig up a fix. I’ll post this here just in
case someone else ends up afflicted. There’s a [post](http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=145799) on the Minecraft
forums that I can vouch for, having done it myself. Follow the
directions and stop falling off cliffs or into lava.
