Mitch Garnaat’s excellent [Python and AWS Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020202.do) is now 50% off($6.49) in Ebook format (ePub, Mobi, PDF). The book features some great
recipes, straight from the maintainer of [boto](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

While the book isn’t unfriendly to those looking at boto for the first
time, it really shines for those who have done some tinkering with boto
in the past. Mitch gets right to the point, providing ample explanations
for each recipe. The EC2 sections were particularly useful for me. We
use boto heavily at DUO, but I managed to learn some great new tricks
with instance management by reading through the examples.

For about $7, this is a great read, and a great way to show appreciation
for an excellent project.

*Addendum:There is no monetary motivation for my cheerleading; I thought
I’d share this with others (the special is easy to miss).*
