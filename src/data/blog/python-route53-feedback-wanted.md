Late last night (or early this morning), I finished the draft of[python-route53](https://python-route53.readthedocs.org), a stand-alone [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) module with Python 3.x and
Python 2.7 compatibility. [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) is an excellent DNS service
offered by Amazon Web Services. It exposes everything through an API.

My intentions with python-route53 are two-fold:

* There were no Python 3 compatible Route 53 modules that I knew of. I
  had a need for one.
* I didn’t feel like any of the existing Route 53 modules were as
  simple and easy-to-use as they could be.

What I’d like to do is reach out and get some feedback on whether I have
succeeded or not in both regards. I’d like to get a packaged release out
later this week, but hoped to get some eyeballs on the documentation and
the source before it lands on PyPi.

If you’d like to take a look, see the [python-route53 documentation](https://python-route53.readthedocs.org)
and the [project at Github](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-route53). Feel free to leave issues on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-route53/issues) with feedback, or [tweet](https://twitter.com/gctaylor) at me.
