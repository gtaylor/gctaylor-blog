Some of the first multiplayer games I played were text-based MUDs. Theiraccessibility, the imagination required, and the variety of places to
spend time was great. Myself and a close friend had a few favorite
places to haunt online, and had a blast exploring other people’s worlds.

We stumbled through Apocalypse, played Shades of Evil at its height,
cyborged our way through Thunderdome, and finally got sucked into
BattletechMUXs of various kinds. Times changed, we moved on to greater
things in life, but I keep catching myself looking back at MUDs as an
ideal gaming medium for me. This may sound strange to some of you, which
is why I made sure to add that “for me” part at the end of that last sentence.

*But why would anyone want to play these crummy, crude, text-based games
when there are so many massive, beautiful titles to spend time and money on?*

These crummy, crude, text-based games offer a minimalistic, focused way
to game. They are typically free, they can be developed and iterated
upon rapidly, and new content is exponentially easier to add than to a
graphical game. The element of imagination is perhaps the single
strongest appeal to me in a MUD.

I am sure by now that some are wondering where I’m going with this. To
that, I answer: I am once again spending some free time hacking on a
game concept I’ve been mulling over in my head for a few months. I’d
like to borrow desirable elements from my favorite games, and make
something that is fun for me, and hopefully others, to play.

I have no idea if I’ll get far enough to have something playable, but I
have finally, after a few years of thinking, found an overall idea that
I like and can make progress towards a clear goal on. More to come on
this later, but I’ll be doing the development in the open on GitHub.
While the more astute of you can find the project already, I’ll hold off
on announcing anything until I have something interesting to show (if ever).
