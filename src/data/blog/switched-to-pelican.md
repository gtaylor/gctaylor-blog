For the last four years, my blog has been powered by Django. As I have foundmyself becoming more and more busy, I have stopped wanting to hassle with
keeping things up to date on the server and the application.

After a weekend of tinkering and conversions, I’m now up and running on
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/). Generation is relatively quick, I like that it uses Jinja, and
blogging in Restructured Text is strangely… relaxing? The only downside
is that the documentation, while reasonably complete, has some unclear
spots (custom page generation and RSS/Atom feed settings in particular).
