To top January up, boto 2.2.0 has been released, bringing in, amongstother things, [DynamoDB support](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/dynamodb_tut.html). See the full [release notes](https://github.com/boto/boto/wiki/Release-Notes-for-boto-2.2.0) for the
nitty-gritty. Feedback is actively being sought for the [DynamoDB
module](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/ref/dynamodb.html), so please do open an issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/boto/boto/issues) if you run into
issues or have suggestions.

Also, we’re making a ton of progress on the documentation front. If
you’d like to help, check out the [documentation issues](https://github.com/boto/boto/issues?sort=created&labels=Documentation&direction=desc&state=open) in the
tracker, and/or hop in #boto in FreeNode. We’re in need of people
familiar with various boto sub-modules to step up and contribute their
knowledge, or give their respective module’s tutorials/api references
some love.
