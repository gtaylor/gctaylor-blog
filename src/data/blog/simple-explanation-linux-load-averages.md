I’ve noticed that some people coming from Windows or other backgroundsoften mis-interpret Linux load averages, or don’t understand them at
all. Check out this great rough overview post, [Understanding Linux CPU
Load](http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2009/07/31/understanding-load-averages). While there is, of course, more to it than the article goes
over, this will plug some basic knowledge gaps.
