After sufficient embarrassment, I have finally forced myself to updatethe site. In addition to a visual overhaul, I’ve updated the codebase to
use Django 1.3, and brought in a lot of the pieces of our stack we use
at [DUO Interactive](https://github.com/duointeractive).

I’ve also made the updated source for this site available in its
entirety on [GitHub](https://github.com/gtaylor/gsite). As a disclaimer, I don’t have the time or will to
support the codebase, and it’s mostly there just so I can get this thing
under version control. Perhaps it will be of use to someone as an
example, though.
