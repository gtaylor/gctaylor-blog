[paypal-python](https://github.com/gtaylor/paypal-python) 1.2.5 has been released with a small Python 3 compatibility fix (thanks to brutasse).

Note: For the sake of clarification, paypal-python is for the older Python NVP API. You probably don't want to use this for any new projects if [PayPal-Python-SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK) (official from PayPal) supports the calls you need.
