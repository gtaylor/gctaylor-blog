I have open sourced the [tailscale-subnet-router](https://github.com/gtaylor/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tailscale-subnet-router) Helm Chart that I’ve been using in my home lab. The Chart is based on the [YAML examples](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/tree/main/docs/k8s) provided in the tailscale repo.

I hope this saves some time for someone else out there!
