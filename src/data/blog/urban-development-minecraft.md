I recently stumbled across an article on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/news) about how oururbanisation tendencies translate really well to the world of
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net). [Urbanisation in Minecraft](http://crafthub.net/2011/07/22/urbanisation-in-minecraft/) details the experience of one
of four founding members of a Minecraft server as it sees explosive
growth, eventually developing sprawl and resource shortages in centers
of population.

While this can’t be taken too scientifically (that’s not really the
point), it is a very interesting read. Check the [article](http://crafthub.net/2011/07/22/urbanisation-in-minecraft/) out on Crafthub.
