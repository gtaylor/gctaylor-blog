There has been a good deal of progress made towards getting [boto’sdocumentation](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/index.html) up to snuff. We’ve been working on cleaning up what is
there, and have even added some new content (like the new [DynamoDB
tutorial](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/dynamodb_tut.html)). However, there is [much](https://github.com/boto/boto/issues?labels=Documentation&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) left to be done.

We would greatly appreciate some outside eyes on this. We’d love to see
what you think we could do to improve the boto documentation. Please
feel free to visit the [boto issue tracker](https://github.com/boto/boto/issues?labels=Documentation&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) and fire away. If you
mention **@gtaylor** in the body of your issue, I’ll be sure to get it,
and can label and route it.

For the ambitious
-----------------

If you’re feeling particularly motivated, we’d love to have your pull
requests. The boto documentation is all in  reStructuredText, compiled
by the excellent Sphinx. You can expect to be reasonably productive with
about 30 minutes of peeking at the [Sphinx documentation](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html) and looking
at what we have.

In particular, we need tutorials covering some of the modules we lack
tutorials for. If you know any of [these](https://github.com/boto/boto/issues?labels=Documentation&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) modules pretty well, please
consider throwing something our way.
