I missed this yesterday, but Amazon Web Services has just now announcedthe general availability (leaving beta) of they Identity Access
Management service. One of the cool things about this is that there is
now a tab for IAM in the web-based management console. This means that
you now have an alternative to the previous “you have to do it all
through the API for now”.

More details can be found on the [Amazon Web Services blog](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/05/identity-and-access-management-console-support.html).
