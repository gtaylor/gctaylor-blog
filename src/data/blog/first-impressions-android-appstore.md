I took a moment to give Amazon’s new [Appstore](http://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?ie=UTF8&node=2350149011) a quick run-throughtoday, and thought I’d mind dump a few assorted thoughts.

Competition is a good thing
---------------------------

One of the worse thing about monopolies is the lack of motivation to
change, adapt, and listen to the needs of customers. Why bother bending
to the wills of your users when you’re the only option? What if I (Joe
Consumer) don’t agree with the selection process a store uses to
determine which apps make the cut? When there’s only one option, I’m out
of luck, and at the provider’s mercy.

Even if Amazon Appstore ends up being an also-ran (which I suspect it
will), it’s putting some amount on Google to continue improvement of
their Market. I sincerely hope that Amazon improves to the point where
the competition pushes both parties to innovate.

The concern of fragmentation is somewhat unfounded
--------------------------------------------------

“Fragmentation” is a term used in a lot of FUD campaigns. It is
important to keep in mind the fact that Google’s Market will be the
default (much like IE is for Windows), and will likely always be. Most
of us will probably look there first. But just like I can navigate away
from eBay to Amazon while looking for something, I can now do the same
with apps. Maybe one has something priced cheaper. Maybe the superior
quality of one causes policy changes in the other. A win-win just for
having to tap a piece of glass a few times (instead of clicking).

It’s also important to realize that we deal with fragmentation every
day. Have you ever downloaded software from somewhere other than
Microsoft Update, Mac’s App Store, or one of Linux’s many package
managers? We get software from all kinds of different sources, and I’m
glad for the fact.

Amazon may not ultimately succeed, but this is a victory for the
consumer. Developers that are annoyed at having to submit to multiple
places will probably have their concerns answered by a service that
handles submissions to multiple sources. Or the process in general will
be streamlined to the point where it’s not an issue.

As far as the store itself
--------------------------

There were some definite positives, and there were the expected
early-life issues. First, the good:

* I liked being able to select apps for download from the web and have
  them pulled by my device, like Google Market does (as long as the
  Amazon Appstore app is running).
* Amazon’s recommendation engine is pretty nice. Google’s is not nearly
  as good. This is one of those places that I expect Google will have
  to improve to compete.
* The web interface is decent.

Now the bad:

* The Android app’s UI is pretty clunky. I suspect they’ll fine tune
  this over time, just like all other similar products have done. This
  is not a deal-breaker.
* As expected, the selection is limited. Not a deal-breaker yet, we’ll
  give them some tme.

A delicate balance
------------------

The only thing out of all of this that sends up red flags is that Amazon
is instituting an approval process similar to Apple’s. However, I cringe
less at that is the fact that Amazon isn’t also the platform provider
(as Google is to Android). Amazon doesn’t care if your Photo Gallery app
competes with Android’s, as long as it adds a quality replacement.

I did see a statement that anything pornographic will be denied, which
is fine, but we’ll see what constitutes pornographic material soon.
There was also mention that the approval process might take a week,
which might dissuade some developers.

Summary
-------

Amazon’s Appstore is the first attempt that comes to mind for an
alternate phone app store **at this scale**. They are very much pioneers
of this for Android, and maybe the smartphones in general. The Appstore
does not have enough clout to make it something I’ll spend a ton of time
thumbing through just yet, but I will certainly peek at it from time to time.

Fragmentation is a non-issue, and I welcome the competition that Amazon
brings against Google and others thinking of doing the same thing. The
consumer wins when we have more than one option. Just like individual
app stores will evolve and improve, I expect the whole alternate app
store thing to become a lot more natural with time. Perhaps Google will
even embrace this and offer some additional programmatical facilities
for developers.
