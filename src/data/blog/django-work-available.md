A quick tip for anyone with time to spare: The company I work for, DUOInteractive, LLC, is in need of some extra Djangonauts for some small to
mid-sized projects. The work is payable on an hourly basis, and can
scale up or down based on availability. Most of the projects are for the
[Ligonier Ministries](http://ligonier.org) site, which sees about 10,000 visitors a day.

Those with a firm understanding of Python/Django (and some free time)
may send resumes to [jobs@duointeractive.com](mailto:jobs@duointeractive.com).
