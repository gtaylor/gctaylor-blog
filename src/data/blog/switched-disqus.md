Up until today, I have been an IntenseDebate user for the last twoyears. I even wrote a [blog post](http://gc-taylor.com/blog/post/28/) about why I chose [IntenseDebate](http://intensedebate.com/)
over [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) back in 2010. However, the scene has changed quite a bit
since then, leading me to re-evaluate my comment system.

The primary reason for the switch is that IntenseDebate has failed to
improve at a rate anything like Disqus. Disqus is more attractive, loads
without as much layout jarring, and has managed to attract a huge
following. At the time of my first decision, they were on much more
equal footing.

We appreciate the hard work of both services, and thank IntenseDebate
for serving us well for so long.
