After some more time in the cooker, [python-route53](https://python-route53.readthedocs.org/) 1.0 has landed on[PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/route53). This is a stand-alone [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) package, independent from the
one in boto. The major hilights are:

* Python 2.7 and 3.x compatibility.
* Extremely simple API
* Powered by [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

Read the [documentation](https://python-route53.readthedocs.org/), see the [source](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-route53), and yell at me on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/gtaylor/python-route53/issues) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gctaylor).
