It was only a matter of time before work started on something like*Guitar Hero* that uses a real guitar as a “controller.” [Guitar
Rising](http://www.guitarrising.com/) by GameTank, Inc. is looking very interesting. Instead of using
a little plastic, five-button controller, plug in your guitar of choice
and get to it.

The advantage to this over *Guitar Hero* and *Rock Band* is that the
player is actually learning how to play a real instrument, meanwhile
enjoying many of the aspects that made this game’s predecessors so successful.

The only unfortunate thing is that *Guitar Rising* isn’t due out until
late 2008, which more or less means early to mid 2009. This one is
definitely worth keeping an eye on.

See the [Official Site](http://www.guitarrising.com/) or the [Gizmodo Article](http://gizmodo.com/352800/guitar-rising-for-real-guitar-heroes) for more details.
