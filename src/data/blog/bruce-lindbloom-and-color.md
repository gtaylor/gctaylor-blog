Color Science is a complex topic that can be hard to find documentationfor without purchasing books. For those on a budget, [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) and
Google can turn up some useful information, but there are often glaring
omissions, inaccuracies, or questions left un-answered.

Luckily, Bruce Lindbloom has compiled an excellent website
([brucelindbloom.com](http://brucelindbloom.com)) full of Color Science information, calculators,
and examples. Of particular use are some of the following:

* [CIE Color Calculator](http://brucelindbloom.com/ColorCalculator.html) - Conversions between color spaces.
* [Useful Color Equations](http://brucelindbloom.com/Math.html) - Conversions, Delta E, misc. other equations.
* [Delta E (CIE 2000)](http://brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_DeltaE_CIE2000.html)

While a lot of the material is a bit hard to get into without a basic
understanding of color, it’s definitely worthwhile to pick through if
you’re in the Graphic Communication industry (or are just curious about
the topic).
